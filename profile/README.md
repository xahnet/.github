# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Not associated the hacktivist group called Xahnet
I have been using the xah postfix on my name for many years and this resulted in all my networks and servers having the xah prefix, xahnet.net for exmaple

## Only 1 contributer on this org
I am merely using the organisation to use a self hosted runner for my repos without having to set this up for each one of my repos
